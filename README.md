Hi, my name is Kyle Andrus. I graduated with Honors from UC Davis in December 2020 with bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Cinema & Digital Media. I'm interested in the intersection between the two, specifically 3D computer graphics and rendering for animation, AR/VR, and video games.

My coursework includes Computer Graphics (C++), Geometric Modeling (C++), Advanced Computer Graphics (C++), Computer Animation (C++/C#), Computer Vision (MATLAB), Artificial Intelligence (Java), Computer Architecture, Operating Systems (C), Object-Oriented Programming (C++), Data Structures (C++), Algorithm Design, Game Programming (Unity, C#), Character Animation (Maya), Physics, Calculus, and Linear Algebra.

I'm an avid hiker, world traveler and amateur photographer. I'm also a huge sports fan, particularly of the English Premier League, NFL, NBA, and Formula 1!
