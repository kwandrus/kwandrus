Hi, my name is Kyle Andrus. I graduated from UC Davis in December 2020 with Honors and have bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Cinema & Digital Media. I'm currently searching for an entry level C++ Software Engineer position in the San Francisco Bay Area. I have a specific interest in 3D computer graphics and rendering for animation, AR/VR, and video games.

My CS coursework includes Computer Graphics (C++), Geometric Modeling (C++), Advanced Computer Graphics (Graduate Level, C++), Computer Animation (Graduate Level, C++, C#), Computer Vision (MATLAB), Artificial Intelligence (Java), Game Programming (Unity, C#), Computer Architecture, Operating Systems (C), Object-Oriented Programming (C++), Data Structures (C++), Algorithms, Physics, Calculus, Linear Algebra.

I'm an avid hiker and world traveler and I'm a huge sports fan, particularly of the English Premier League, NFL, NBA, and Formula 1 :)
