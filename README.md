Hi, my name is Kyle Andrus. I graduated with Honors from UC Davis with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Cinema & Digital Media. I have a particular interest in computer graphics programming for 3D animation, AR/VR, and video games.

UC Davis Summer 2020 Internship: I was one of the three Unity developers who created https://graddev.itch.io/enggradgame, along with a research team and a team of artists who created each of the art assets.

I'm an avid hiker, world traveler, amateur photographer, and a big fan of the English Premier League, NFL, NBA, and Formula 1!
