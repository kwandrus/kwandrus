Hi, I'm Kyle. I graduated from UC Davis with a  in Computer Science and Cinema & Digital Media. I have a particular interest in computer graphics programming for 3D animation, AR/VR, and video games.

I'm also an avid hiker, world traveler, amateur photographer, and a big fan of the English Premier League, NFL, NBA, and Formula 1!
