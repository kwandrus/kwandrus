Hi, I'm Kyle. I'm a QA Automation Engineer at Esri and I graduated from UC Davis in 2020 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Cinema & Digital Media. I'm interested in all things related to 3D computer graphics.

I'm also an avid hiker, world traveler, amateur photographer, and a big fan of sports!
