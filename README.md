Hi, my name is Kyle Andrus. I graduated with Honors from UC Davis with bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Cinema & Digital Media. I'm interested in the intersection between the two, specifically computer graphics programming in the field of 3D animation, AR/VR, and video games.

I'm an avid hiker, world traveler, and amateur photographer. I'm also a huge sports fan, particularly of the English Premier League, NFL, NBA, and Formula 1!
